# DesignSPHysics

DesignSPHysics is a software module built into [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/) that provides a Graphical User Interface for [DualSPHysics](http://dual.sphysics.org/). It is under development since September 2016 and in Beta stage.

Check the [Official Webpage](http://design.sphysics.org) for downloads and more information.

## Description
DesignSPHysics enables the user to create cases with solids and fluids and exports it to a DualSPHysics compatible format. In addition, it does the hard work for the user, generating the case data automatically, simulating, and post-processing, all inside FreeCAD.

It includes support for pre-processing with GenCase, simulation with DualSPHysics and post-processign with several tools of the DualSPHysics package.

In the future the code will be modular, so integration with different SPH solvers can be used. Right now it's optimized to be used with DualSPHysics

It is developed as a FreeCAD module with a macro bootstrapper, in Python 3.5+, using the QT libraries via PySide.

## Installation instructions
To install DesignSPHysics you have 2 options: Using the FreeCAD Addon manager for an stable version, or installing manually whatever version that you like from git.

### Installing a release version
To install a release version, open FreeCAD 0.18+ and go to the menu *Macro -> Macros...* From there, press the *Addons...* button on the bottom right corner, search for DesignSPHysics and click *Install / Update*. FreeCAD will advise you to reboot the application and you'll be set.

Take in mind that as it includes DualSPHysics, the package may take a while to download.

To execute DesignSPHysics just open the same Macro dialog and double click DualSPHysics.

### Installing a development build
Clone the branch that you like from this repository and rename the folder to 'DesignSPHysics'. Then copy the folder to the Mod folder of the FreeCAD installation directory. 

By default, for example, in Windows, it is located in `%appdata%/FreeCAD/Mod` or in Linux in `~/.FreeCAD/Mod`

Then copy the file `DesignSPHysics.FCMacro` of this repository into the FreeCAD macro directory (`%appdata%/FreeCAD/Macro` on Windows; `~/.FreeCAD/Macro` on GNU/Linux)
