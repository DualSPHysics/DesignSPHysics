# DesignSPHysics

DesignSPHysics is a software module built into [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/) that provides a Graphical User Interface for [DualSPHysics](http://dual.sphysics.org/). It is under development since September 2016 and in Beta stage.

Check the [Official Webpage](http://design.sphysics.org) for downloads and more information.

## Project Overview
DesignSPHysics enables the user to create cases with solids and fluids and exports it to a DualSPHysics compatible format. In addition, it does the hard work for the user, generating the case data automatically, simulating, and post-processing, all inside FreeCAD.

### Training courses
 * [4th Hands-on course on experimental and numerical modelling of wave-structure interaction](https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/hands-on-course-2024), Florence, Italy, on **1-5 July 2024**.
 * [7th DualSPHysics Workshop](https://dual.sphysics.org/7thworkshop/), Politecnico di Bari, Italy, on **19-21 March, 2024**.

### Releases
 * [v0.7.0](https://github.com/DualSPHysics/DesignSPHysics/releases/tag/0.7.0) has been released (15-09-2023). See [CHANGELOG file](CHANGELOG.md)

It includes support for pre-processing with GenCase, simulation with DualSPHysics and post-processign with several tools of the DualSPHysics package.

In the future the code will be modular, so integration with different SPH solvers can be used. Right now it's optimized to be used with DualSPHysics

It is developed as a FreeCAD module with a macro bootstrapper, in Python 3.5+, using the QT libraries via PySide.

## Installation

To install DesignSPHysics, you have two options:

### Installing a Release Version
1. Open FreeCAD 0.18+ and navigate to `Macro -> Macros...`.
2. Press the `Addons...` button in the bottom-right corner, search for DesignSPHysics, and click `Install / Update`.
3. Reboot FreeCAD as advised, and you're ready to use the module.

### Installing a Development Build
1. Clone the branch of your choice from the repository and rename the folder to `DesignSPHysics`.
2. Copy this folder to the `Mod` folder in your FreeCAD installation directory:
    * On Windows: `%appdata%/FreeCAD/Mod`
    * On Linux: `~/.FreeCAD/Mod`
3. Copy the `DesignSPHysics.FCMacro` file from the repository into the FreeCAD macro directory:
    * On Windows: `%appdata%/FreeCAD/Macro`
    * On Linux: `~/.FreeCAD/Macro`
