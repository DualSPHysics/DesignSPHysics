    Attributes:
        startawas: Time to start AWAS correction
        swl: "Still water level (free-surface water)
        elevation: Order wave to calculate elevation 1:1st order, 2:2nd order
        gaugex: Position in X from piston to measure free-surface water
        gaugey: Position in Y to measure free-surface water
        gaugezmin: Minimum position in Z to measure free-surface water, it must be in water
        gaugezmax: Maximum position in Z to measure free-surface water (def=domain limits)
        gaugedp: Resolution to measure free-surface water, it uses Dp*gaugedp
        coefmasslimit: Coefficient to calculate mass of free-surface
        savedata: Saves CSV with information
        limitace: Factor to limit maximum value of acceleration, with 0 disabled
        correction: Drift correction configuration
